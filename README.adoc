=== Creating/Binding an app

* Create a link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as this example.
+
* The app name and appId need to be specified into the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as follows.
+
[source,shell]
----
  # The appName spec defines the name of the app used to bind the service
  appName: "app"
  # The appId spec defines the appId of the app used to bind the service
  appId: "appid"
----
+
* Run the following command to bind the app to the Mobile Security Service
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make apply-app-example
----

NOTE: This command will just apply the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example with `kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml`

=== Deleting/Unbinding an app

* Run the following command to delete/unbind the app from the service and remove its SDKConfigMap.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make delete-app-example
----

IMPORTANT: This command will just delete the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example with `kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml`
NOTE: The Rest Service endpoint to delete it is called in the finalizer of the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] and the CR will be just allowed to be removed when the app is no longer available in its Service.

=== Uninstall

Use the following command to delete the Operator, the Service and its Database and all related configuration applied by the `install` of this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ make uninstall
----

== Configuration and Options

=== Operator Namespace

By using the command `make install` the default namespace `mobile-security-service` defined in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] will be created and the operator will be installed in this namespace. You are able to install the operator in another namespace if you wish, however, you need to set up its roles (RBAC) in order to apply them on the namespace where the operator will be installed. The namespace name needs to be changed in the link:./deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml[Cluster Role Binding] file. Note, that you also need to change the namespace in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] in order to use the command `make application/install` for another namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
  # Replace this with the namespace where the operator will be deployed.
  namespace: mobile-security-service
----

=== Namespace to apply MobileSecurityServiceApp

Only namespaces specified in the environment variable `APP_NAMESPACES` can be used to apply Apps. If the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] is applied to a namespace that is not specified in `APP_NAMESPACES` it will be ignored. Refer to configuration in the link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml] file.

IMPORTANT: The values should be split by `;`. E.g `mobile-security-service-apps;example-namespace-apps`

NOTE: To run the project locally export the ENV VAR. E.g. `export APP_NAMESPACES=mobile-security-service-apps`

=== Oauth Configuration

An Oauth Proxy container and the required configuration will be setup by default by the operator to provide authentication to the Mobile Security Service.

=== Environment Variables and ConfigMap

Environment Variables are used to configure the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] Application and Database. For further information on configuration see the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service#setup-and-configurations[Setup and Configuration] section.

=== Monitoring Service (Metrics)

The application-monitoring stack provisioned by the
https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[application-monitoring-operator] on https://github.com/integr8ly[Integr8ly]
can be used to gather metrics from this operator. These metrics can be used by Integr8ly's application monitoring to generate Prometheus metrics, AlertManager alerts and a Grafana dashboard.

It is required that the https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator[integr8ly/Grafana] and https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus] operators are installed. For further detail see https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator].

The following commands will enable the monitoring service where the operator has been installed in the default namespace with the make commands.

[source,shell]
----
make install-monitoring
----

Also, you are allowed to setup it manually as follows.

[source,shell]
----
# Go to the operator namespace

$ oc project mobile-security-service
----

[source,shell]
----
# Installation of ServiceMonitor

$ kubectl label namespace mobile-security-service monitoring-key=middleware
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/monitor/operator_service.yaml
----

[source,shell]
----
# Add AlertManager rules to prometheus

$ kubectl apply -f deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml
----

[source,shell]
----
# Add Grafana dashboard

$ kubectl apply -f deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard.yaml
----

IMPORTANT: The namespaces are setup manually in the files link:./deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml[ServiceMonitor], link:./deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules], link:./deploy/monitor/operator-service.yaml[Operator Service], and link:./deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard[Grafana Dashboard]. Following an example from the link:./deploy/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules]. You should replace them if the operator is not installed in the default namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
  expr: |
          (1-absent(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"})) or sum(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"}) != 3

[source,shell]
----

NOTE:  `make uninstall-monitoring` will uninstall the Service.

=== Database image and parameters

The database image and its parameters and their default values are configurable and specified by the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB CR].

== Development

=== Architecture

This operator is `cluster-scoped`. For further information see the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope[Operator Scope] section in the Operator Framework documentation. Also, check its roles in link:./deploy/[Deploy] directory.

NOTE: The operator, application and database will be installed in the namespace `{namespace}` which will be created by this project.

=== Local Setup

Run the following command to setup this project locally.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make setup
----

=== Running the operator locally

The following command will install the operator in the cluster and run the changes performed locally without the need to publish a `dev` tag. In this way, you can verify your code in the development environment.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make run-local
----

IMPORTANT: The local changes are applied when the command `operator-sdk up local --namespace={namespace}` is executed then it is not a hot deploy and to get the latest changes you need re-run the command.


=== Debugging

Follow the below steps to debug the project in some IDEs.

NOTE: The code needs to be compiled/built first.

==== IntelliJ IDEA / GoLand

[source,shell]
----
$ make debug-setup
$ cd cmd/manager/
$ dlv debug --headless --listen=:2345 --api-version=2
----

Then, debug the project from the IDE by using the default setup of `Go Remote` option.

==== Visual Code

[source,shell]
----
$ make debug-setup
$ dlv --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec ./build/_output/bin/mobile-security-service-operator-local  --
----

debug the project using the following Visual Code launch config.

[source,yaml]
----

            "env": {},
            "args": []
        }
    ]
}
----

=== Publishing a new version

To publish a new version of the operator:

- bump the version TAG in the link:./Makefile[Makefile].
- bump the version in the link:./version/version.go[version.go] file.
- update the version number in the link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml].
- update the link:./CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG.md]
- add a git tag to the commit you wish to build the release from
- push the tag to github (this will trigger an automated release by the CI)

Note: https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] should be followed.

Images for the mobile-security-service-operator are published to https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[Quay.io].

==== Automated image publishing

Images are automatically built and pushed to our https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[image repository] in the following cases:

- For every change merged to master a new image with the `master` tag is published. 
- For every change merged that has a git tag a new image with the `<operator-version>` and `latest` tags are published.

If the image does not get built and pushed automatically the job may be re-run manually via the https://circleci.com/gh/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[CI dashboard].

==== Dev images

The following commands will build the project and publish it to our https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[image repository] with the tag <version>-dev.

[source,shell]
----
$ make build-dev
$ make push-dev
----

NOTE: You will require `quay.io` credentials and access to publish images to the `quay.io/aerogear` organisation.

=== Using the dev tags

To use the dev image update the image in the file link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml] with the development tag as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
# Replace this with the built image name
image: aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator:0.1.0-dev
----

NOTE: The image/tag used from https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] is defined in link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml] file.

== Supportability

This operator was developed using mainly the Kubernetes APIs in order to be compatible with both, however, currently this project requires the usage of the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/rest_api/apis-route.openshift.io/v1.Route.html[v1.Route] to expose the service and https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[OAuth-proxy] for authentication which make it unsupportable for Kubernetes.
