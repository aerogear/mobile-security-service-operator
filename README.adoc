== Getting Started

=== Cloning the repository

By the following commands you will create a local directory and clone this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator
----

=== Minishift installation and setup

https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[Install Minishift] then enable Operators on it by running the following commands.

[source,shell]
----
# create a new profile to test the operator
$ minishift profile set mss-operator

# enable the admin-user add-on
$ minishift addon enable admin-user

# add insecure registry to download the images from docker
$ minishift config set insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16

# start the instance
$ minishift start
----

=== Installing

Use the following command to install the Operator, Service and its Database.

NOTE: To install you need be logged in as a user with cluster privileges like the `system:admin` user. E.g. By using: `oc login -u system:admin`.

[source,shell]
----
$ make install
----

To verify that the pods has been successful created you can run the following command.

[source,shell]
----
# Go to the project namespace. E.g mobile-security-service
$ oc project mobile-security-service

# Check the pods which are deployed
$ oc get pods
NAME                                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mobile-security-service-569d4f8d86-vp5hq            1/1       Running   2          1h
mobile-security-service-db-ccb5856f6-8qnvc          1/1       Running   0          1h
mobile-security-service-operator-785cbdbf46-wq2lf   1/1       Running   0          1h

----

To verify that the installation was successful completed you can check the `AppStatus=` status field of link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[Service CR] and the `DatabaseStatus=OK` status field of link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[Database CR] in the cluster. For both are expected this status fields be added with the value "OK" when all installation process is finished and are all created successfully as the following example.

[source,shell]
----
# To check the Service CR
$ oc describe mobilesecurityservices.mobile-security-service.aerogear.com
...
  Route Name:                        route
  Size:                              1
Status:
  App Status:       OK
  Config Map Name:  mobile-security-service-config
  Deployment Name:  mobile-security-service
...

# To check the Database CR
$ oc describe mobilesecurityservicedbs.mobile-security-service.aerogear.com
...
  Size:                      1
Status:
  Database Status:  OK
  Deployment Name:  mobile-security-service-db
  Deployment Status:
...
----

NOTE: To troubleshooting the installation if it does not complete successfully check the status of its CRs. Note that all objects which are managed by them has an respective status field on it. E.g `Deployment Status`

=== Creating/Binding an app

* Create a link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as this example.
+
* The app name and appId need to be specified into the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as follows.
+
[source,shell]
----
  # The appName spec defines the name of the app used to bind the service
  appName: "app"
  # The appId spec defines the appId of the app used to bind the service
  appId: "appid"
----
+
* Run the following command to bind the app to the Mobile Security Service
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make example-app/apply
----

NOTE: This command will execute `kubectl apply -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml` and apply the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example.

=== Deleting/Unbinding an app

* Run the following command to delete/unbind the app from the service and remove its SDKConfigMap.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make example-app/delete
----

IMPORTANT: This command will execute `kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml` and delete the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example.

NOTE: The Rest Service endpoint to delete it is called in the finalizer of the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] and the CR will be just allowed to be removed when the app is no longer available in its Service.

=== Uninstalling

Use the following command to delete the Operator, the Service and its Database and all related configuration applied by the `install` of this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ make uninstall
----

NOTE: To uninstall you need be logged in as a user with cluster privileges like the `system:admin` user. E.g. By using: `oc login -u system:admin`.

== Configuration and Options

=== Customizing the Service

The Mobile Security Service image and its parameters are configurable and specified by the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityService CR].

NOTE: Default values are applied by the operator in link:./mobile-security-service-operator/pkg/controller/mobilesecurityservice/mandatory_specs.go[mandatory_specs.go] are applied for the mandatory specifications which are not made in the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityService CR].

=== Customizing the Database

The database image and its parameters are configurable and specified by the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB CR].

NOTE: Default values are applied by the operator in link:./mobile-security-service-operator/pkg/controller/mobilesecurityservicedb/mandatory_specs.go[mandatory_specs.go] are applied for the mandatory specifications which are not made in the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceddb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB CR].

=== Changing the operator namespace

By using the command `make install` the default namespace `mobile-security-service`,  defined in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] will be created and the operator will be installed in this namespace. You are able to install the operator in another namespace if you wish, however, you need to set up its roles (RBAC) in order to apply them on the namespace where the operator will be installed. The namespace name needs to be changed in the link:./deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml[Cluster Role Binding] file. Note, that you also need to change the namespace in the link:./Makefile[Makefile] in order to use the command `make install` for another namespace. 

[source,yaml]
----
  # Replace this with the namespace where the operator will be deployed.
  namespace: mobile-security-service
----

=== Managing valid namespaces to apply the MobileSecurityServiceApp

Only namespaces specified in the environment variable `APP_NAMESPACES` can be used to apply Apps. If the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] is applied to a namespace that is not specified in `APP_NAMESPACES` it will be ignored. Refer to configuration in the link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml] file.

IMPORTANT: The values should be split by `;`. E.g `mobile-security-service-apps;example-namespace-apps`

NOTE: To run the project locally export the ENV VAR. E.g. `export APP_NAMESPACES=mobile-security-service-apps`

=== Changing the Environment Variables values

Environment Variables are used to configure the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] Application and Database. For further information on configuration see the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service#setup-and-configurations[Setup and Configuration] section.

=== Monitoring Service (Metrics)

The application-monitoring stack provisioned by the
https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[application-monitoring-operator] on https://github.com/integr8ly[Integr8ly]
can be used to gather metrics from this operator and the mobile security service. These metrics can be used by Integr8ly's application monitoring to generate Prometheus metrics, AlertManager alerts and a Grafana dashboard.

It is required that the https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator[integr8ly/Grafana] and https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator[Prometheus] operators are installed. For further detail see https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator].

The following commands will enable the monitoring service where the operator has been installed in the default namespace with the make commands.

[source,shell]
----
make install
----

Also, you are allowed to setup it manually as follows.

[source,shell]
----
# Go to the operator namespace

$ oc project mobile-security-service
----

[source,shell]
----
# Installation of ServiceMonitor for Operator and Mobile-Security-Service

$ kubectl label namespace mobile-security-service monitoring-key=middleware
$ kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/mss_service_monitor.yaml
$ kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/operator_service.yaml
----

[source,shell]
----
# Add AlertManager rules to prometheus

$ kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml
----

[source,shell]
----
# Add Grafana dashboard

$ kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard.yaml
----

IMPORTANT: The namespaces are setup manually in the files link:./deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml[ServiceMonitor], link:./deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules], link:./deploy/monitor/operator-service.yaml[Operator Service], and link:./deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard[Grafana Dashboard]. Following an example from the link:./deploy/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules]. You should replace them if the operator is not installed in the default namespace.

[source,yaml]
----
  expr: |
          (1-absent(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"})) or sum(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"}) != 3

[source,shell]
----

NOTE: The command `make monitoring/uninstall` will uninstall the Monitor Service.

== Development

=== Architecture

This operator is `cluster-scoped`. For further information see the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope[Operator Scope] section in the Operator Framework documentation. Also, check its roles in link:./deploy/[Deploy] directory.

NOTE: The operator, application and database will be installed in the namespace `{namespace}` which will be created by this project.

==== Oauth Authentication

An Oauth Proxy container and the required configuration will be setup by default by the operator to provide authentication to the Mobile Security Service.

=== Local Setup

Run the following command to setup this project locally.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make setup
----

=== Running the operator locally

The following command will install the operator in the cluster and run the changes performed locally without the need to publish a `dev` tag. In this way, you can verify your code in the development environment.

[source,yaml]
----
$ make code/run/local
----

IMPORTANT: The local changes are applied when the command `operator-sdk up local --namespace={namespace}` is executed then it is not a hot deploy and to get the latest changes you need re-run the command.

=== Checking Database

By the following commands you are able to connect in the Mobile Security Service Database. You can check it by OpenShift UI in the Database's pod terminal.

[source,shell]
----
# Login into the the Postgres
psql -U postgres

# To connect into the default database
\c mobile_security_service

# To list the tables
\dt

# To select all data from the app table
SELECT * FROM app;
----

=== Debugging

Follow the below steps to debug the project in some IDEs.

NOTE: The code needs to be compiled/built first.

NOTE: The link:./Makefile[Makefile] is implemented with tasks which you should use to work with.

== Publishing images

Images are automatically built and pushed to our https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[image repository] in the following cases:

- For every change merged to master a new image with the `master` tag is published.
- For every change merged that has a git tag a new image with the `<operator-version>` and `latest` tags are published.

If the image does not get built and pushed automatically the job may be re-run manually via the https://circleci.com/gh/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[CI dashboard].

== Tags Release

Following the steps

* Create a new version tag following the http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[semver], for example `0.1.0`
* Bump the version in the link:./version/version.go[version.go] file.
* Update the the link:./CHANGELOG.MD[CHANGELOG.MD] with the new release.
* Create a git tag with the version value, for example:

[source,shell]
----
$ git tag -a 0.1.0 -m "version 0.1.0"
----

* Push the new tag to the upstream repository, this will trigger an automated release by the CI, for example:

[source,shell]
----
$ git push upstream 0.1.0
----

NOTE: The image with the tag will be created and pushed to the https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service[mobile-security-service image hosting repository] by the CI.

WARNING: Do not use letters in the tag such as `v`. It will not work.

== Supportability

This operator was developed using mainly the Kubernetes APIs in order to be compatible with both, however, currently this project requires the usage of the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/rest_api/apis-route.openshift.io/v1.Route.html[v1.Route] to expose the service and https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[OAuth-proxy] for authentication which make it unsupportable for Kubernetes.
