----
+
IMPORTANT: Do not forget to update the clusterHost into the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceunbind_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceUnbind CR]
+
* Run the following command to unbind the app from the service
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make unbind
----

=== Removing

Use the following command to delete the Operator, the Service and its Database as roles from the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
$ make delete-all
----

IMPORTANT: To create all you need be logged as admin. Use `oc login -u system:admin`.

== Configurations and Options

=== Environment Variables and ConfigMap

The environment variables are used to configure the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] Application and Database. For a further understatement over its configuration see https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service#setup-and-configurations[Setup and Configurations] section in https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service README].

NOTE:

* All values used in the default configuration came from the config-map which is managed and created by the Operator. This config map will be created in the Operator namespace and its name is defined by the attribute `configMapName` in the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityService CR].
* If the name of this ConfigMap be not specified then the name of the Mobile Security Service instance will be used instead of.
* The link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB] and link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityService] should have specified the same name for this ConfigMap in order to allow the App and Database share its usage.

=== Role for no-privilege users are able to create the Mobile Security Service App, Database and/or Bind and Unbind their apps

By executing the following commands you will create roles in the cluster which will allow the <user> create the Mobile Security Service Application and Database in their namespaces. In this would not be required be the system:admin. However, the Mobile Security Service Operator is cluster scoped and will still only accessible for the `system admin users.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc create rolebinding developer-mobile-security-service-operator --role=mobile-security-service-operator --user=<user>
$ oc create rolebinding developer-mobile-security-service --role=mobile-security-service --user=<user>
----

=== Database image and parameters

The database image and its parameters as their default values are configurable and specified by the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB CR].

== Development

=== Architecture

This operator is `cluster-scoped`. To know more over it see the topic https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope[Operator Scope] in the Operator Framework documentation. Also, check its roles in link:./deploy/[Deploy] directory.

NOTE: The operator, application and database will be installed in the namespace `mobile-security-service-operator` which will be created by this project.
