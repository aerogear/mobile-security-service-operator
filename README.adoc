=== Creating/Binding an app

* Create a link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as this example.
+
* The app name and appId need to be specified into the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] as follows.
+
[source,shell]
----
  # The appName spec defines the name of the app used to bind the service
  appName: "app"
  # The appId spec defines the appId of the app used to bind the service
  appId: "appid"
----
+
* Run the following command to bind the app to the Mobile Security Service
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make create-app
----

NOTE: This command will just apply the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example with `kubectl create -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml`

=== Deleting/Unbinding an app

* Run the following command to delete/unbind the app from the service and remove its SDKConfigMap.
+
[source,shell]
----
$ make delete-app
----

IMPORTANT: This command will just delete the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] example with `kubectl delete -f deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml`
NOTE: The Rest Service endpoint to delete it is called in the finalizer of the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] and the CR will be just allowed to be removed when the app is no longer available in its Service.

=== Removing

Use the following command to delete the Operator, the Service and its Database as roles from the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
$ make delete-all
----

== Configuration and Options

=== Operator Namespace

By using the make command `make create-all` the default namespace, e.g `mobile-security-service`, will be created and the operator will be installed on it. You are able to install the operator in another namespace as you wish,
however, you need setup its roles (RCBA) to by applied on the namespace where the operator will be installed. The namespace name need to be changed in the link:./deploy/cluster_role_binding.yaml[Cluster Role Binding] file in the following line.

[source,yaml]
----
  # Replace this with the namespace where the operator will be deployed.
  namespace: mobile-security-service
----

=== Namespace to apply MobileSecurityServiceApp

This operator will just working with the namespaces which are specified in the environment variable `APP_NAMESPACES` and the link:./deploy/crds/examples/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityserviceapp_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceApp CR] which be applied in a NAMESPACE which was not defined on it will be ignored. See its configuration into the link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml] file.

IMPORTANT:The values should be informed split by `;`.

NOTE: To run the project locally export the ENV VAR. E.g `export APP_NAMESPACES=mobile-security-service-apps`

=== Oauth Configuration

An Oauth Proxy container and the required configuration will be setup by default by the operator to provide authentication to the Mobile Security Service.

=== Environment Variables and ConfigMap

Environment Variables are used to configure the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] Application and Database. For further information on configuration see the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service#setup-and-configurations[Setup and Configuration] section.

NOTE:

* All values used in the default configuration are sourced from the config-map which is managed and created by the Operator. This config map will be created in the Operator namespace and its name is defined by the attribute `configMapName` in the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityService CR].
* If the name of this ConfigMap is not specified then the name of the Mobile Security Service instance will be used instead.

=== Monitor Service (Metrics) for the Integr8ly project

The application-monitoring stack provisioned by the
https://github.com/integr8ly/application-monitoring-operator[application-monitoring-operator] on https://github.com/integr8ly[Integr8ly]
can be used to gather metrics from this operator. These metrics can be used ONLY by Integr8ly's application monitoring to generate Prometheus metrics, AlertManager alerts and a Grafana dashboard

Run the following commands if this project was installed with the make commands in the default namespace to enable this service.

[source,shell]
----
make install-service-monitor
----

Also, you are allowed to setup it manually as follows.

[source,shell]
----
# Go to the operator namespace
oc project mobile-security-service

# Installation of ServiceMonitor
kubectl label namespace mobile-security-service monitoring-key=middleware
kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml
kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/operator_service.yaml

# Add AlertManager rules to prometheus
kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml

# Add Grafana dashboard
kubectl create -f deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard.yaml
----

IMPORTANT: The link:./deploy/monitor/service_monitor.yaml[ServiceMonitor], link:./deploy/monitor/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules], link:./deploy/monitor/operator-service.yaml[Operator Service], and link:./deploy/monitor/grafana-dashboard[Grafana Dashboard] needs to be applied in the same namespace where the operator is installed.

NOTE: The namespace is setup manually in this files as follows example from the link:./deploy/prometheus-rule.yaml[Prometheus Rules].

[source,yaml]
----
  expr: |
          (1-absent(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"})) or sum(kube_pod_status_ready{condition="true", namespace="mobile-security-service"}) != 3

[source,shell]
----

=== Database image and parameters

The database image and its parameters and their default values are configurable and specified by the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicedb_cr.yaml[MobileSecurityServiceDB CR].

== Development

=== Architecture

This operator is `cluster-scoped`. For further information see the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/user-guide.md#operator-scope[Operator Scope] section in the Operator Framework documentation. Also, check its roles in link:./deploy/[Deploy] directory.

NOTE: The operator, application and database will be installed in the namespace `{namespace}` which will be created by this project.

    ]
}
----

=== Publishing a new version

To publish a new version of the operator:

- bump the version TAG in the link:./Makefile[Makefile].
- bump the version in the link:./version/version.go[version.go] file.
- update the version number in the link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml].
- update the link:./CHANGELOG.md[CHANGELOG.md]
- add a git tag to the commit you wish to build the release from
- push the tag to github (this will trigger an automated release by the CI)

Note: https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning] should be followed.

Images for the mobile-security-service-operator are published to https://quay.io/repository/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[Quay.io].

==== Automated image publishing

- For every change merged to master a new image with the `master` tag is published
- For every change merged that has a git tag a new image with the `<operator-version>` and `latest` tags are published

If the image does not get built and pushed automatically the job may be re-run manually via the https://circleci.com/gh/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator[CI dashboard].

==== Dev images

The following commands will build the project and publish it to `quay.io/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator` with the tag <version>-dev.

[source,shell]
----
$ make build-dev
$ make push-dev
----

NOTE: You will require `quay.io` credentials and access to publish images to the `quay.io/aerogear` organisation.

=== Using the dev tags

To use the dev image update the image in the file link:./deploy/operator.yaml[operator.yaml] with the development tag as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
# Replace this with the built image name
image: aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator:0.1.0-dev
----

NOTE: The image/tag used from https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] is defined in link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml] file.

NOTE: The link:./Makefile[Makefile] is implemented with tasks which you should use to work with.

== Supportability

This operator was developed using mainly the Kubernetes APIs in order to be compatible with both, however, currently this project requires the usage of the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/rest_api/apis-route.openshift.io/v1.Route.html[v1.Route] to expose the service and https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy[OAuth-proxy] for authentication which make it unsupportable for Kubernetes.
