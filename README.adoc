== Overview

A https://commons.openshift.org/sig/OpenshiftOperators.html[Operator] based on the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Operator SDK] to run the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] on a OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster.

== Prerequisites

|===
|https://golang.org/doc/install[Install Golang]
|https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH[Ensure the $GOPATH environment variable is set]
|https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html[Install the dep package manager]

|https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#install-kubectl[Install kubectl]
|===

== Getting Started

=== Cloning the repository

By the following commands you will create a local directory and clone this project.

[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:aerogear/mobile-security-service.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service-operator
----

=== Minishift installation and setup

https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[Install Minishift] then enable Operators on it by running the following commands.

[source,shell]
----
# create a new profile to test the operator
$ minishift profile set mss-operator

# enable the admin-user add-on
$ minishift addon enable admin-user

# add insecure registry to download the images from docker
$ minishift config set insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16

# start the instance
$ minishift start
----

=== Configuring

Update the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml[mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservice_cr.yaml] with your cluster/host IP.

NOTE: The `clusterHost` will be used to generated the route/ingress source as in the ConfigMap created with the SDK JSON config.

=== Installing

Use the following command to create the Operator, the Service and its roles on the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
$ make create-all
----

IMPORTANT: To create all you need be logged as admin. Use `oc login -u system:admin`.

=== Removing

Use the following command to delete the Operator, the Service and its roles from the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
$ make delete-all
----

IMPORTANT: To delete you need be logged as admin. (`oc login -u system:admin`)

== Configurations and Options

=== Environment Variables

The environment variables are used to configure the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] Application and Database. For a further understatement over its configuration see https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service#setup-and-configurations[Setup and Configurations] section in https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] README.

NOTE: All values used in the default configuration came from the config-map which is managed and created by the Operator.

=== Watch specifications for the MobileSecurityServiceBind (CR)

The Bind watches the applications in the cluster in order to create, delete and update the data in the https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-security-service[Mobile Security Service] by it REST API. It is the CR responsible for "bind/unbind/re-bind" the applications to the Service and by it CR properties which follows you will be able to define what applications should be watched/checked by this operator. For a further understanding check the link:./deploy/crds/mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicebind_cr.yaml[mobile-security-service_v1alpha1_mobilesecurityservicebind_cr.yaml] file.

=== Role for no-privilege users are able to create the Mobile Security Service App and Database

By executing the following commands you will create roles in the cluster which will allow the <user> create the Mobile Security Service Application and Database in their namespaces. In this would not be required be the system:admin. However, the Mobile Security Service Operator is cluster scoped and will still only accessible for the system admin users. (E.g `oc login -u system:admin`)

[source,shell]
----
$ oc create rolebinding developer-mobile-security-service-operator --role=mobile-security-service-operator --user=<user>
$ oc create rolebinding developer-mobile-security-service --role=mobile-security-service --user=<user>
